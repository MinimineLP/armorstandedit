If you have not installed DManager you can download it on the dmanager website

### Get the Book
At the moment there is no fancy way of getting the book, you can just get it using the following command
```
/function ase:get_book
```
There will be an option to get the book for non-administrators in the future.

## Usage

Using the Book you get a lot of options.

## Planned
- Usefull tools as copy, paste, flip
- Presets for the armor stands that will propably come as additional datapack
- An animation library that makes it possible to animate armor stands, this one will be an additional library datapack because it needs active commands all the time and not just to create the stands
